## Objective

A/B testing of three different promotions for fast food restaurants to determine if the differences are statistically significant and to identify which promotion is best for sales growth.

## EDA (in EDA.ipynb)

Details about the exploratory data analysis can be found in the EDA.ipynb notebook.

## Hypothesis Testing

- H0 (null hypothesis): There is no difference in sales between Promotion 1, Promotion 2, and Promotion 3.
- H1 (alternative hypothesis): There is a difference in sales between Promotion 1, Promotion 2, and Promotion 3.
- Significance level: 0.05
- Confidence level: 95%
- Statistical test: one-way ANOVA, Tukey's test

## Conclusion

We conclude that Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 do not show a statistically significant difference from each other, while Promotion 2 is significantly different from both. However, Promotions 1 and 3 exhibit the highest sales performance. On average, choosing Promotion 1 or 3 would result in an approximate 15% increase in total monthly sales, equivalent to $1,302,000 compared to Promotion 2.
